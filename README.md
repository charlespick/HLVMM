# Home Lab Virtual Machine Manager
Like System Center Virtual Machine Manager, but worse. 

**Advantages of using HLVMM**
* You don't need a SCVMM License
* You don't need SQL Server
* Not another thing to maintain in your homelab
* Lightweight - only runs on your workstation

**Disadvantages of using HLVMM**
* It basically only does template provisioning
* It kinda sucks - use at your own risk
