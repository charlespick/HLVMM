Currently:
We can locate the image, clone it, make the vm, make an unattend file, make an iso of that file, copy that to the hypervisor, mount it, and specialize the vm
Windows is failing to specialize from the files generated

Next steps:
Try packing a native unattend file made by the official tool Windows SIM and see if there are required fields missing
If it's determined that no required fields are missing (the natively generated file works), then we need to work towards making sure the generated file is exactly as expected
If there's a problem with the officially generated unattend file, we need to diagnose that first then update the function
Progress on the linux side hasn't begun yet

Further:
Separate out specialization file creators into their own file, per OS
Create naming convention for images to specify os version
Convert to module
Review all functions to ensure standard parmeter, variable naming, and all varables used in functions are accesible via parameters
Clean up cluster(object) vs cluster(string) nonsense
Create examples folder
Add a "You're about to create a VM with these specs" confirmation
Further refine code compartmentalization
Support additional OSes
Support runOnce commands
Support DHCP
Separate out some things. For example, create an object like "WindowsOSSpecializationSettings" or "LinuxOSSpecializationSettings" that gets created and passed to the up front function so the command isn't a mile long
Further refine code flows
GUI/frontend
