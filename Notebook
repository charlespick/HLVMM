Currently:
We can locate the image, clone it, make the vm, make an unattend file, make an iso of that file, copy that to the hypervisor, mount it, and specialize the vm
Windows is failing to specialize from the files generated

Next steps:
Try packing a native unattend file made by the official tool Windows SIM and see if there are required fields missing
If it's determined that no required fields are missing (the natively generated file works), then we need to work towards making sure the generated file is exactly as expected
If there's a problem with the officially generated unattend file, we need to diagnose that first then update the function
Progress on the linux side hasn't begun yet
